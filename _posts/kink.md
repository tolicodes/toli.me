# Kink Ideas

Chatturbate (stream yourself having sex and make money) - this was an incredible experience. Raised my self esteem so much. We weren't even doing anything too sexual most of the time. One day we had a fantasy show where we acted out a story about a queen and her dragon. We had something like 5000 viewers watching us at once. That's more than a TED conference worth of audience, all focused on you. And people are so supportive. As a guy I've never received so many complements on my appearance. I was called hot, beautiful, nice ass, nice dick, sexy, etc by dozens of people. I always thought of myself as average looking (many times I saw myself as unattractive even). But hey, there was confirmation that at least 5000 people find me attractive. Confidence +1000
- Boat sex: we rented a boat for the weekend. Amazing experience. We had sex with the blinds open, and someone actually cheered us on! Another time we were on a small yacht and played captain and first mate
- Ocean sex
- Pool sex
- Jacuzzi sex
- Mirror sex: put a mirror across your bed (or on your ceiling). It's so hot watching yourself and your partner from different angles
- Dirty Talk: still getting a hang of this, it takes practice, but once you get comfortable it can be so hot.
- Playing with ice cubes - melt it on their body with your mouth
- Candle wax - ouch!
- Sexting - also takes a bit of practice. You can start by sending sweet nothings "thinking of you", "you're so cute" and then move on to "can't wait to get home so I can xyz your abc". I'd like to get better at this. Creating the anticipation while you're away…and then coming home 🔥
- Tying up/ropes/Shibari - I tried it, but to get really good takes practice. I'd love to try suspending and that kind of stuff.
- Hand cuffs - cool story here. It was Halloween. And a roommates handcuffed me and my partner together. We had sexy time and then we went to a club (me in my towel, her in a bathing suit). And we danced handcuffed together. So hot
- Blindfold - really enhances the other senses
- Smell play - this was fun. I once went to sabon and spent hours picking out fragrances. I put the ones I likes on sample pads and individually wrapped them (the store clerks were super accommodating). Then I got home, put a blindfold on her and we had sex while I put random smells to her nose. Really amazing experience.
- Make up sex: it feels so good getting back together. Not always the best idea…but great sex
- Not getting back together but no strings attached sex: actually this was even hotter. We decided we really can't have a relationship together. But we were both horny. And it was an amazing experience. We actually had a pretty "meh" sex life in our relationship, but this was so different. I felt a lot more free and this was the first time I heard her so vocally satisfies, possibly gave her multiple orgasms. Very different from a one night stand (I actually didn't enjoy these). You get all the fun of the emotions and knowing the person, and loving the person, with no expectations or obligations
- Nibbling and biting: funny story, I actually lost a tooth doing this. It was already loose, but made an interesting explanation to my dentist. Playful biting can be a lot of fun
- Naked wrestling: very primal. Also if you're having an argument, it's one of the best ways to let all the anger and pressure out. There's something satisfying about overpowering someone and being overpowered. Dogs play fight all the time. Why can't we? A lot of times after, we forgot why we were arguing.
- Naked massage: really amazing to set the mood, and once you start exploring massage with someone you love, you can spend hours exploring every nook and cranny of their body
- Oil massage: adds slipperiness. Especially if you rub your oily body on theirs. Amazing feeling. Warning: DO NOT use a condom. Made that mistake, condom broke, not fun.
- Massage story telling: this is really fun. You make up a story and tell it on their body. So you might be talking about a river and your fingers form a river on her back, a tickling stream
- Record a sexy visualization: make up a wonderful story and record it. Great to send if you don't live together to get them thinking about your next time together ;)
- Sing to them: another amazing aphrodisiac. Sing your favorite love song over the phone or in person. Sing each other to sleep.
- Costumes: this is a lot of fun! You can dress up as anything from a teacher/student to something random like a dinosaur and dog. I'd love to play with this more
- Role Play: you can role play without a costume. I role played an FBI agent, teacher, student, thief (I stole her dog and she said "ooooh please mr. toli, give me back my dog, I'll do anything"), probably a bunch of other stuff I forgot
- Meet up as strangers at a restaurant/bar: I got this idea from modern family. You come to a restaurant separately, as strangers. And pretend you just met each other. Role playing recommended. I was an FBI agent and she was a veterinarian. And then you pretend to fall in love with each other all over again, while having safety of knowing you won't be rejected, so you can take risks! Great way to renew that NRE
- Spanking: tip, do it when they're already warmed up or while fucking. Much better way to ease into it
- Flogging: move up a level. I haven't done this too much
- Restraints: you can get restraints and tie them to the bed posts. And do whatever you want! Great trust exercise. Also great with a blindfold
- Ball gag: I dunno but it's sexy
- Pull hair: again best done while fucking
- Loud sex: go someplace where people won't hear you (or will hear you 😋) and have sex as loud as you can. It's so satisfying to scream
- Crying sex: cathartic if done right
- Parent role play: getting a bit into the weird category. Daddy/daughter is pretty standard. But I've also done mommy/daughter (that's an interesting one), I've been called a mommy-daddy, and I've done mother-child. Great way to work on your daddy/mommy issues
- Watching partner masturbate: you get to learn what they like. And it's kinda hot. You get to watch but not touch
- Both masturbating: you get to touch yourself in all the ways you like and focus on your pleasure but also look at your partner's hot bod in extacy
- Acid Sex: it is so hard to describe. You become one with your partner. It's really surreal. Try it at least once but only with someone you're comfortable with (I've heard it can get quite weird). Sadly can't do drugs any more
- Molly sex: you just want to hug and fuck everything. I remember once I was dry humping a punching bag. Also it's really great for getting into your body and feeling it. You can feel all your bones stack, the limits of your muscles. Basically all that stuff you're supposed to feel after practicing yoga for years, but a shortcut. Careful on this one, you can build a dependency.
- Weed sex: along the lines of acid sex, but not nearly as strong
- Adderol sex: actually don't remember how this went, guess it didn't stand out
- Bring God into sex: have God/the universe as part of the sex experience. Makes it a lot more spiritual and connected. I'd like to explore this more
- Exhibitionism: leave your blinds open, do it against a window
- Back yard sex: you might be seen, but still your property
- Sex toys: there are sooo many. I've tried dildos, vibrators, butt plugs, curved butt thingies, nipple clamps
- Double penetration with a dildo/vibrator and penis (or two vibrators).
- Threesome: a lot you can do here. I haven't had many or explored that much in them. But one of my best experiences was with a friend. We kissed a girl all over her body when she woke up, and she giggled! Another time I had a three some with my coworker and his husband. All the attention was on me. I felt so loved and special! Another time, we were just playing around with a girl, I wasn't that into the girl, or sexually into my friend, but weirdly the whole experience was really fun. I felt very intimate with my friend
- Sex games: truth or dare you can download on your iPhone or make up your own
- Shower sex: great place to get into butt stuff and pee play. Insta clean.
- Pee play: pee on someone, get peed on, taste their pee (haven't done that one), it sounds weird but you'd be surprised. It's not just for r kelly
- Shaving your partner: one of my most memorable intimate experiences. Great way to build trust and you get a shiny, smooth vagina/penis to play with after
- Watch porn together: and copy some moves
- Don't wear panties all day: this is very hot. Especially if you randomly mention it. You can look under the table. But nobody knows
- Naked Acro yoga: great workout, and you can get into some very strategic positions (ex: folded leaf)
- Naked yoga: bendy bendy fun!
- Work out sex: right after or during a workout, few things turn me on more than a girl working out. All the sweat is just so sexy.
- Period sex: less gross than it sounds. Actually great lubrications. And wondeful for taking away cramps.
- Washing machine sex: vibrations are amazing. Even more risqué in your building's laundry room. Someone actually knocked while we were doing it, added to the excitement
- Lingerie - so sexy from the moment you start shopping for it together
- Dance for each other - dim the lights, put on some music and do a sexy dance
- Be strippers
- Pole dance - I actually had a pole in my house at one point. I must've used it for sex at some point, don't remember
- Sex in every room of the house, every corner of the room: great way to move in together
- Sex on a table
- Sex standing up
- Sex on the floor
- Sex in a forest
- Sex in different countries and states - I've done australia, tanzania, Vietnam, NY, CA, AZ (I think). I've got a ways to go.
- Being very creative with how your bodies fit together - basically contact improv but naked. So many cool things you could without penetration
- Orgasm denial: they can't cum until you say so
- Edging: make them almost cum, then stop, and repeat
- Foot job
- Same room sex: this was pretty hot. Me and my partner had sex on one bed. And my best friend as his partner on another bed. In the same room. we could hear each other and see each other and kinda just all turned each other on. Awesome bonding experience. Great intro to swinging and poly
- Have sex on bed while someone is sleeping: my best friend had sex with some one on my bed while I was sleeping. Can't imagine how hot that must've been
- Sex in friend's bathroom: and all the thumbs up that follow
- Sex in a club bathroom: tried it once, got kicked out, it was kinda awkward
- Sex with a lesbian: not as glamorous at it seems. We didn't have chemistry…I guess as expected
- Apply sunburn lotion: this was an interesting experience. My friend had a sunburn and asked me to apply aloe. And that is how we started dating
- Sex while complimenting each other/saying sweet things
- Back scratching: this is so good especially when you're about to cum. I think wouldn't mind if they left a mark even, never went that far
- Sex with someone much older: I think my oldest was in her 40s, at a sex party. I had a pretty intimate relationship with someone 10 years older than me.
- Sexual scavenger hunt: this was fun. We were at her mom's house and went on a scavenger hunt downstairs for suggestive objects and then played with them. You'd be surprised what you have laying around the house
- Choking: great before you cum, but careful here
- Sex under the stars: bring a mattress outside and have sex under the stars
- Breathing together: lie on top of them and synchronize your breaths. One person leads. Another follows. This feels amazing
- Sex Haidus: don't have sex for a few days or weeks. But tease each other. And when you do have sex. Omg.
- Blow job/eat out while in a meeting/on the phone: there's something hot about being on the phone with someone, or on a zoom call, and getting head. Not being able to show it.
- Morning head: best way of waking up is getting your dick sucked (new Folgers commercial)
- Sleepy sex: having sex with someone (with prior permission of course) while they asleep/dozing off/before they wake up - imagine it feels pretty surreal
- Consensual non consent: saying no when you mean yes. Pick a safe word though
- Sex in a public park
- Sex on the beach: isn't just a drink, there are hotels that section off a private section of the beach just for you and plenty of abandoned beaches for the more brave
- Giving oral while She's on top: feels nice to feel that vulnerable as a guy
- Getting suffocated while giving oral: especially when she cums and squeezed her legs around you. It feels good having her in control
- Crying sex: can be very cathartic
- Dressing In latex: it contours their body so nicely
- Rimming: lick the asshole. It feels nice. Good intro to anal.
- How many finger can you put up there: start with one and work your way up slowly. It's a fun game, and a fun challenge to keep trying to beat your record
- Food play: whipped cream, chocolate syrup, eating really whatever off your boo makes it taste so much sweeter
- Passing food back and forth in the mouth: works great with chocolate or ice cream
- Group sex: well I haven't done group sex but I've done a very erotic naked cuddle/massage party
- Pretend to have babies: even if you practically don't want babies now you can imagine you're making a baby during sex and talk about how cute he's going to be and how much you're gonna love him. This is definitely one of the most loving and connected I've felt during sex, even though we definitely didn't want babies for at least a few years
- Cum of various body parts: mouth, face, ass, vagina, back, hair, ear? It all washes off
- Thrusting without penetration: put your penis in between her legs and rub against her but not inside her. So hot and so good once you put it in
- Sex in each other's fluids: if you cum multiple times (great for all day sex) you end up in each others' fluids. So dirty and sexy
- Licking someone's ear: one partner loooved it when I licked the inside of her ear
- Sensation play: play around by rolling various object on your partner's skin. Something rough, something smooth, something slimy. Great when blindfolded
- Sexy naked (or bikini) Photoshoot: great way to raise self esteem
- Naked cooking: one person puts a blind fold on the other, and then directs them in cooking without words, only using their body. And then they're desert 😏 great trust exercise
- Make them beg for it: play around and tease them but don't put it in unless they beg for it. This is an interesting one because it can bring out insecurities about being unwanted. But can also heal them
- Act out any trauma: great way to heal trauma is through sex with someone you trust. Boss yelled at you? Act it out. Got attacked by a dog? Act it out? Abusive dad? Act it out. I think that sex is a playground to get all that repressed stuff out in the open
- Cheating fantasy: if you're insecure about cheating, act out a fantasy where you cheat on them
- PDA: see how far you can push PDA. Making out? Dry humping? Touching each other just enough to not make it illegal? It's fun pushing boundaries. PDA is one of my favorite things. I love showing my love and being proud of it. I bet it inspires some to be more loving and adventurous themselves
- Spooning: just lying behind your partner, holding them tight, your bodies as one. This has actually been some of my most intimate experiences. Spiritual even. Thinking of one moment I feel such unconditional love and a connection to god.
- Silent sex: you can't make a noise! Or you'll get caught
- See what you can get away with by being cute and in love: you'd be surprised how much leeway people give to a young hot couple (probably a cute old couple too!) doesn't matter, people just love to support true love. We have gotten into hotel pools that we weren't part of, just by asking, we were invited to private shows and volley ball games, on $500/night resorts just because we wandered on. We got tons of free things and upgrades and whatnot just by showing our love. Seriously, try it. Don't hide your love. Cash it in 🤑
- Sex day: don't leave your bed all day
- Sex in the rain: yes it's as romantic as it sounds
- Flash boobs randomly: especially in public when no one is looking. What a nice surprise and gets the fire started
- Candle lit sex: yes it's classic but still romantic as f***
- Acrobatic sex: hold them in weird positions. It's not exactly efficient but very fun
- Sex with music
- Sing romantic songs to each other
- Lick every part of the body
- Edible panties
- Sex party: great way to get into poly or swinging even if you don't participate
- Get instructions on every move: your partner tells you exactly what to do
Submersion play: dunk someone under water and have them hold their breath. I had a partner who loved the water and sometimes we would play around like that.
Blow air into your partner and suck it out completely: basically mouth on mouth crating a tunnel. Form of breath play

Things I'd Like to Do

- Masturbating them under the table
- Car sex - got a blowjob once, never penetration, although plenty of opportunities

- Sex toys: there's a bunch I haven't tried.

- strap on: get pegged
- Body paint each other
- Cover each other in paint and have sex on a canvas
- Mile high club: I'm still not sure what the rules are…can you get banned from the air line? Fined? Jailed? I hear people doing it. There's even an app where you enter your flight number to hook up with someone
- Train sex/bus sex: blow job under the covers?
- Sex while camping - had the chance wasn't horny that night.
- Sex under a waterfall

- Rip off your partner's clothes
- Kidnapping fantasy: actually drive up in a van and kidnap them
- Dating someone younger: I don't remember If I ever have. All my long term partners were older.
- Alien abduction: I had a partner who claimed she had a mystical sex experience with aliens (she wasn't kidding). It would've been great to reenact that
- Stocks: restrain in weird positions
- Sex swing: bought one, never had the chance to use it
- Hammock sex: again, had plenty of opportunities never did it
- Master/slave - can start outside the bedroom and continue in the bedroom. Tell her what to do. I kind of did this (both sides) but not to extend others do it

- Giving someone an enema - I'd imagine it's a pretty intimate experience. And makes but play more clean (although I'm not too squeamish)

- Watching a live sex show (maybe joining in??)
- Face fucking: aggressive blow job
- Fisting: putting your entire first in someone's vagina/ass
- Wearing opposite clothes: if you're a cis men, what would it be like to wear a dress?
- Sex up high: like a roof or a water tower. I'm afraid of heights so this would be extra exhilarating or extra scary for me. I'd like to find out!
- Knife play: I don't know if I'm ready for this one yet, but maybe in the future I'd be open to it. Basically cut each other. Pretty dangerous.
- Cum smoothie: this is another weird one. I love how girl's cum tastes (not so much guy's). It would be interesting to collect some and make a smoothie
- Latex gloves: great to play around in the ass if you're squeamish
- Giant dildo: would be really hot to see my partner take a giant dildo up the ass or vagina and play around with upping the size (anal training)
- Sex somewhere abandoned: like maybe an abandoned house
- Graveyard sex: spooky!!
- Squirting: I think I made someone squirt once. But I can't do it reliably. It's sooo hot though. Like the female equivalent of jizzing
- Playing with fear: doing scary things but including sex. Could maybe help you get over the fear
- Sex therapy: discuss something traumatic during sex. I love playing therapist…surprised I haven't done this
- Sex in a walk in freezer
- Sex in the snow: I tried it at the very beginning of my sex life. Didn't like it. But things might have changed
- Sex with someone pregnant: this would be interesting…I don't want biological kinds, but maybe if I was in a poly relationship with someone having a kid. Always wondered what it'd be like
- Blowjob contest: I'd love to be blindfolded and given multiple blowjobs and choose the winner. And vice versa, would love to give oral along with a few others to one lucky lady
- Rape fantasy: I'd imagine it could be healing to reframe an awful experience
- Sensory deprivation sex: sex in one of those sensory depravation tanks must be amazing (it might be a challenge finding someone who'd let us)
- Sounding: this is another one I'm not sure I'm ready for. It involves inserting thin tubes in your urethra. I have kidney stones (it is likely to recur multiple times in my life). So maybe this would be a good way to take away the fear
- Using an optical camera inside vagina: I've seen a few videos of sex from inside the vagina. I'd love to see myself live entering and leaving and cumming
- Sex with tattooed girl
- Sex with girl with piecing: I wonder what a blow job with a piercing feels like, or giving oral to someone with a ring in their clit. Or inter course (not sure about the geometry of that)
- Inter course with another object inside: like a dildo or something small. Kinda like DV or DA
- Suspension: tie up with ropes and hang up side down
- Having your partner wear panties with your cum on it all day
- Uniform: I've heard I could make a good police man. Or maybe I can be a shirtless fireman.
- Pretending to be animals: I'm surprised I haven't tried it. I must have at some point but don't remember
- Sex at work: had plenty of chances. Never done it. I once brought my partner for Halloween. We dressed up as dogs and sniffed each others' butts. HR disapproved. A little.
- Sex on an elevator: pretty sure there's a song about it
- Use a vibrator on your partner while they're tied up. They don't get to tell you to stop
- Electric play: zap em
- G spot: found it!
- Male  g spot: haven't found mine either
- Tantric sex
- Kama sutra
Kigurimi: this is basically furries Lite. Onsies that look like animals or mythical creatures. I used to love dressing in a husky onesie my ex got me after I admired her dinosaur onesie. I first met her in that dinosaur onesie at a nude retreat (rule breaker!) and I fell in love with it (and her). It's a great way to get into yiffing without spending $2000 on a suit. Actually fun story, her and I went to my work Halloween party as two dogs (she has a corgi and I was a husky). And we walked around on all 4s and sniffed each others' butts. HR was (just slightly) displeased 😉
Forced orgasm
Dental/Medical play-torture with medical tools
Temperature play
Knife play
Breath play
Hunting prey - go to a forest and hunt your partner. When you catch them you get to do whatever you want with them
Write a sex contract: like in 50 shades of gray. With soft limits and hard limits. Great way to find out what you're into and maybe use this guide as inspiration

Fantasy ideas
Cuckhold in Sex Club and then Romantic Evening
I've always had kind of a cuckhold(ish) fantasy of having my partner go to a sex club and being fucked every which way by dozens of guys/girls (DP/TP, blowjobs, bukkake, creampies, BDSM, drinking cum, eating ass, whipping, fuck machines, extreme anal play, the weirder the better) for multiple hours while I watch it all and then coming home with me and having a passionate romantic (relatively vanilla) evening. She would tell me how sore she is, and I would gently massage her, rub oil on her, and shower her with compliments, hugs, and kisses. And we would fall asleep on the beach, in each other's ' arms under the stars.
Something about that really really turns me on. Like having her be super sexually free and open and vulnerable to the max with everyone, but still see me as the most important person in her life. It somehow adds to my importance and value. I'm also extremely turned on by sexually open women. Not the ones with inferiority complexes, but ones who really enjoy sex, experimentation, vulnerability, adventure, getting the most out of the world, and putting themselves out there. I dated someone like that (not as extreme as I described, but still up there) and it was incredible. I've never been as attracted or inspired by anyone.
I also love the idea of sharing my partner and letting the world experience her beauty and radiance and power. I like the idea of me and my partner bringing sexual healing and pleasure to others.
It's really interesting how women can be assertive/confident and submissive at the same time. That's my favorite mix 😉
And btw, I enjoy being a Dom myself, a lot. But sometimes I just want to be romantic and cuddly and slow and sensual and lovey Dovey 🥰
Kidnapping Fantasy
I also want to do something very creative and elaborate. Something that takes some planning. Like a kidnapping fantasy. She would consent to the general rules/limits. But everything else is a total surprise. It would be totally random and unexpected, I would drive up in an unknown car, bring her blindfolded to some unknown location with all kinds of toys and tools. And she would play my sex slave for an undisclosed amount of time. Never knowing what to expect next.
I'd also like to be kidnapped in such a way. Just totally trust my partner and fall into that fantasy. Do whatever she tells me to do or get punished.
I think creativity in general is a huge turn on for me, more than the actual fantasy intrinsically. Just pulling off something like that would be insane! Picking the car, the place, the whole plan of what I'll do. And if someone planned all of that for me it would be such an amazing gift. I LOVE well thought out gifts and stuff like surprise parties, all inclusive vacations where I just relax and not think.
I think to make that happen though I'd have to save up a little…and get a bit more brave/confident. And get to know a kink friendly landlord/rich friend with a spare house. I know nothing bad will happen but there's a more than plausible chance of a long, awkward run in with the police somewhere along this plan.
